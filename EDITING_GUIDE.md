# How to edit pravely.com — the easiest way

> **Current-site and companion-workbook guide.** Validate plan, trial, and feature wording against `docs/V1_FEATURE_TRUTH_TABLE_2026-09-15.md`; older workbook offers are historical.

You have 3 options, from easiest (no code) to most powerful. Pick one.

---

## OPTION 1: Just tell Arena (easiest right now)

You are in Arena. You can just say:

> "Change Premium to $59, update the hero to say 'The $19 spreadsheet that replaces your $15/mo app', and swap the screenshots"

I will edit `index.html` / `content.json` and push the change live. No hosting dashboard needed.

**This repo is now your source of truth.** I built it to mirror your live site but make every piece editable in minutes.

---

## OPTION 2: Edit directly on GitHub (no install, 30 seconds)

This is the best long-term if you don't want to touch code or ask an AI.

1. Go to `https://github.com/itbb-creator/pravely.com` on your phone or laptop
2. Open `content.json` → click ✏️ pencil icon
3. Change what you want:
   ```json
   "contactEmail": "support@pravely.com",
   "stripeLinks": {
     "essentials": "https://buy.stripe.com/...essentials",
     "complete": "https://buy.stripe.com/...complete",
     "premium": "https://buy.stripe.com/...premium"
   }
   ```
   To change prices: edit `pricing.essentials.price`, `pricing.complete.price`, `pricing.premium.price`
4. Click **Commit changes**

If you connect this repo to **Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare Pages** (one-time, 2 minutes), that commit auto-deploys to your live site. No FTP, no file manager.

**To change copy beyond price/email:** open `index.html`, hit pencil, search for the text you want (e.g., `Budgeting apps want`), edit it, commit.

> Pro tip: In GitHub, press `.` (period) to open a VS Code editor in your browser. It's like Google Docs for your site.

## OPTION 3: Edit via your current hosting dashboard

Your live site is currently on **AWS (IP 75.2.60.5 via CloudFront)** and your domain is managed at **Squarespace (formerly Google Domains)**. So:

- **Domain (Squarespace):** You do NOT need to touch this to edit the site. It just points `pravely.com` → your host's IP. Leave it.
- **Site files (AWS S3 + CloudFront):** 
  - Log into AWS Console → S3 → find your bucket → upload a new `index.html`
  - Then CloudFront → Invalidate cache `/*` so visitors see the change

This works but is slower than Option 2. **Recommended: move hosting to Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare Pages (free) and connect this GitHub repo.** Then you never log into AWS again.

### One-time setup to make Option 2 auto-deploy (do this once):

**Vercel (recommended, free):**
1. Go to vercel.com → Add New Project → Import `itbb-creator/pravely.com`
2. Framework: `Other` (static), no build command needed
3. Deploy → copy the Vercel URL
4. In Squarespace → Domains → DNS → change A record / CNAME to point to Vercel (Vercel shows you exactly what to paste)
5. Done. Every future `content.json` edit auto-deploys in ~30 seconds.

**Netlify (also free) — this repo is pre-configured:**
1. Go to app.netlify.com → **Add new site → Import an existing project → GitHub** → pick `itbb-creator/pravely.com`
2. Netlify auto-reads `netlify.toml` in this repo (publish: repo root, no build command, branded 404) — just click **Deploy**
3. Site goes live on a `*.netlify.app` URL instantly. Future commits to your deploy branch auto-publish.
4. In Squarespace → Domains → DNS → point `pravely.com` to Netlify (they show the exact A/CNAME records), or transfer DNS to Netlify DNS.
5. Optional CLI: `npm i -g netlify-cli` → `netlify deploy --prod` from the repo folder.

Same general steps work for **Cloudflare Pages**.

## What to edit for common tasks

| You want to... | Edit this file | Find this text |
|---|---|---|
| Change price / Stripe link / email | `content.json` | `pricing.*`, `stripeLinks.*`, `contactEmail` |
| Change headline | `index.html` | `Budgeting apps want` |
| Change pricing cards (features) | `index.html` | `Pravely<br>Essentials` / `Complete` / `Premium` |
| Change hook banner | `index.html` | `FOUNDING PREMIUM · $36` |
| Swap screenshots | `index.html` | `/images/budget-input.png` — replace with real files in `/images/` |
| Change logo / favicon | `images/logo.svg` + `favicon.svg` + `images/logo.png` / `favicon.png` | See below |
| Change FAQ | `index.html` | `Good questions` section → edit `<details>` blocks |
| Wire up forms | This file → “How forms work now” below | — |

## How the support form works

The support page uses a Netlify Form named `support-request`, so customers can contact Pravely without opening an email app. Netlify validates and stores the submission. Configure a form notification in the Netlify dashboard so new requests reach the support inbox.

**To change the notification destination:** update the `support-request` form notification in Netlify. Also update the fallback address in `contact.html` and `content.json`.

---

## Logo & favicon (browser tab)

Your red/green overlapping circles are now:

- `images/logo.svg` — vector logo (used in header nav)
- `images/logo.png` — transparent PNG (3.8KB) for fallback
- `favicon.svg` + `favicon.png` (32x32) — shown in browser tab
- `images/apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180) — shown when someone bookmarks on iPhone home screen

**To replace the logo:** overwrite `images/logo.svg` and `favicon.svg` with your new file (keep same filename) and run this once if you have Pillow:
```bash
python3 -c "from PIL import Image; img=Image.open('images/logo.png'); ... # see git history"
```
Or just tell Arena: "Swap the logo for [upload file]" and I'll regenerate all favicon sizes.

In `index.html` the header uses:
```html
<img src="./images/logo.svg" ...> IN THE BLACK — BUDGET
```
and the tab uses:
```html
<link rel="icon" href="./favicon.svg">
<link rel="icon" href="./favicon.png">
```
